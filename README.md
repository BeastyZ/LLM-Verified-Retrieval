## Requirements
1. We recommend that you use the python virtual environment and then install the dependencies.
    ```
    conda create -n lvr python=3.9.7
    ```
2. Next, activate the python virtual environment you just created.
    ```
    conda activate lvr
    ```
3. Finally, before running the code, make sure you have set up the environment and installed the required packages.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Data
We uploaded the data to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BeastyZ/Llatrieval)ðŸ¤—. 

**Start by installing ðŸ¤— Datasets:**
```bash
pip install datasets
```

**Load a dataset**

This command will download the raw data to the `data/` folder.
```bash
python download_data.py
```

**Download corpus**

Use the following command to download the `BM25_SPHERE_CORPUS`.
```bash
wget -P faiss_index https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/sphere/sphere_sparse_index.tar.gz
tar -xzvf faiss_index/sphere_sparse_index.tar.gz -C faiss_index
```

Use the following command to download the `WIKI_TSV_CORPUS`.
```bash
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dpr/wikipedia_split/psgs_w100.tsv.gz
gzip -xzvf psgs_w100.tsv.gz
```

## Code Structure
* `commands/`: folder that contains all shell files.
* `data/`: folder that contains all datasets.
* `llm_retrieval_prompt_drafts/`: folder that contains all prompt files.
* `llm_retrieval_related/`: folder that contains code for iteratively selecting supporting documents.
* `multi_process/`: folder that contains code for BM25 retrieval with multi-process support.
* `openai_account_files/`: folder that contains all OpenAI account files.
* `prompts/`: folder that contains all instruction and demonstration files.
* `eval.py`: eval file to evaluate generations.
* `Iterative_retrieval.py`: code for reproduce our method.
* `llm.py`: code for using LLM.
* `multi_thread_openai_api_call.py`: code for using gpt-3.5-turbo with multi-thread.
* `searcher.py`: code for retrieval using TfidfVectorizer.
* `run.py`: run file to generate citations.
* `utils.py`: file that contains auxiliary function.


## Reproduce Our Method
**NOTE:** There must be raw data and a corpus for retrieval before running the following commands. Once you have them, you also need to modify the parameters of the corresponding files in the `commands` directory.

For ASQA, use the following command
```bash
bash commands/asqa_iterative_retrieval.sh
```

For QAMPARI, use the following command
```bash
bash commands/qampari_iterative_retrieval.sh
```

For ELI5, use the following command
```bash
bash commands/eli5_iterative_retrieval.sh
```

The result will be saved in `iter_retrieval_50/`.
